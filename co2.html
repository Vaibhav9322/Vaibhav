            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Carbon dioxide (CO₂) is one of the most important greenhouse gases released by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. CO₂ is naturally present in the atmosphere, but human activities have significantly increased its concentration.</p>

            <h2>Sources of CO₂</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Combustion of fossil fuels</li>
                <li>Deforestation</li>
                <li>Industrial processes</li>
                <li>Natural processes like volcanic eruptions</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Global Warming Potential (GWP)</h2>
            <p>CO₂ has a global warming potential (GWP) of 1, meaning it serves as the baseline measure for other greenhouse gases.</p>

            <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
            <p>Increasing concentrations of CO₂ in the atmosphere contribute to climate change, leading to rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, and extreme weather events.</p>
